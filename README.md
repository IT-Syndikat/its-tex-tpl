the basis for other templates.

## Building

`/short` is usually compiled by hand using a command like this:

    $ xelatex -shell-escape -file-line-error -halt-on-error example.tex

Other templates come with a Makefile.

## Issues

Additional input is always welcome, just open an issue or pull request.
